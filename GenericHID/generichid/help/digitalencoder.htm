<h1>Digital Encoder</h1>
<p>A digital encoder is a rotary control that encodes its output as a sequence 
of pulses.&nbsp; Generic HID supports rotary encoders that output their movement 
as incremental quadrature code.&nbsp; Digital Encoders typically have the 
appearance of a panel mount potentiometer, or a machine control dial.</p>
<p>A Digital Encoder has two outputs, A and B.&nbsp; These make up the 
&quot;waveform&quot; of a quadrature signal, with the A and B waveforms out of phase by 90&deg;.&nbsp; Only one signal 
ever changes 
at a time, and from this, Generic HID can determine if the encoder is moving 
forward or backward.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="quad.png" width="328" height="176"></p>
<p>Digital encoders must be connected to Interrupt ports, that is, one of PE4..7, PB0..7, 
PD0..3.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Generic HID represents the digital encoder as an 8-bit input, with wrap 
around.&nbsp; This means it will count up to 255, then wrap to 0 (or down to 0, 
then wrap to 255).&nbsp; It is up to the application using the device to then 
make use of this information.&nbsp; Hidcomp/hidconfig handles this information 
correctly.</p>
<p><i>Care must be taken with the current consumption of digital encoders.&nbsp; 
The larger industrial encoders can draw 100mA, which can overload a USB device.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="hardware.htm#current">USB Power</a> for more information.</i></p>
<p>There is currently no support for mechanical encoders.&nbsp; Mechanical 
encoders are a cheaper version of the digital encoders, that generate the A/B 
signal through mechanical contacts.&nbsp; They need pull-up resistors and 
debounce code to work correctly.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2><h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Digital Encoder.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>


<h3 id="Bits">Bits</h3>
<p>The size of the encoder counter in bits.&nbsp; GenericHID supports up to 16 bit
numbers meaning they can count from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 
(65535).&nbsp; The counter will wrap around the minimum/maximum values.</p>
<p>Depending on the software reading the values, 8 bits is usually enough.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the LED in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="power.htm">Power</a> for more information.&nbsp; <i>
As mentioned above, industrial style dials can use a large amount of current.</i></p>
