<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p>Generic HID is a tool that allows anyone to create their own USB HID device.&nbsp; 
HID is an acronym for Human Interface Device.&nbsp; It is a very general 
specification that specifies how input and output controls should be configured 
so any computer can read them.&nbsp; A HID device can be a joystick, game pad, 
keyboard, mouse, CNC pendant, bar code reader, force feedback device; anything 
that interacts with a user.</p>
<p>Generic HID comprises two parts: hardware and configuration software.&nbsp; 
The hardware can be any Atmel at90usb1287 or&nbsp; at90usb1286 based board.&nbsp; 
The cheapest of these are the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">
teensy++2.0</a> development board or the <a href="http://www.atmel.com">at90usbkey</a> demo board which you can get for 
under $US30.&nbsp; The 
software is open sourced and can be downloaded below.&nbsp; It runs on both 
Linux and Windows&nbsp; By dragging and 
dropping components, then hooking up the pins with virtual wires, the hardware 
can be programmed with the configuration.&nbsp; Then just physically hook up the 
components and viola!&nbsp; A USB HID device!</p>
<p>The picture below show my first test CNC pendant and the software configuration used 
to define it.&nbsp; Click on them for large images.</p>

<p><sub>1. Maximums are based on the number of free pins available on the 
microcontroller.&nbsp; Maximums will be lower if other components are also 
connected.&nbsp; Maxiumums are also reduced based on the electrical load on the 
microcontroller.&nbsp; Maximums can be restricted by the 4kB memory limit of the 
configuration data.&nbsp; Maximums can be restricted by the 64 byte data packet 
size for total inputs and total outputs. Maximums can be restricted by pins that 
are unable to be freed.&nbsp; Maximums should be reduced by common sense.</sub></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>To be able to remotely control my CNC Mill, I started playing the 
		simple USB gamepads.&nbsp; Writing my own drivers for Mach3 and EMC allowed me to 
		configure the gamepad to move each axis with the joysticks, and map the 
		buttons to CNC functions.&nbsp; I made the driver support acceleration 
		profiles, which made the joysticks much more useful.</p>
<p>I played a bit with Contour Design's Shuttle Pro, a USB device that has a few 
buttons, a jog wheel and a dial.&nbsp; I decided this was cool and wanted those 
features in my pendant too.&nbsp; And LEDs to show status information.&nbsp; And 
I wanted an LCD for output.&nbsp; And maybe a buzzer.&nbsp; Since there are no 
pendants out there that can do that (at least any that I can afford), I decided 
to build my own.</p>
<p>At first I looked at disassembling a joystick and a shuttle, and sticking 
everything in one box.&nbsp; That wouldn't give me the outputs, and I'd have to 
run two usb cables (or stick a hub in the pendant) so I decided to 
build from scratch.</p>
<p>My microcontrollers of choice are the Atmel 8-bit chips.&nbsp; They have a 
USB capable range, the AT90USBxxx series, available with 8, 16, 64 and 128k flash 
memories, and versions that supported USB Host or just a device.&nbsp; My 
original plan was to make my own circuit board, but I wanted this project to be 
something I could give back to the internet community, so I chose to use the 
AT90USBKEY as my base.</p>
<p>The AT90USBKEY is a demo board made by Atmel.&nbsp; It is a small board with 
an 8MHz AT90USB1287, along with some flash memory, a simple switched joystick, 
some buttons, LEDs, a temperature sensor and voltage regulators.&nbsp; All I/O 
ports of the microcontroller are accessible via through-holes on the board 
(although at a crappy 0.1&quot; x 0.05&quot; pitch).&nbsp; The board isn't bad value 
either at $30.00 (at <a href="http://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</a> last time I 
looked, or for even cheaper at <a href="http://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</a>, 
$29.99) compared to $15.05 for just the AT90USB1287 chip.</p>
		<p>Recently support was added for the
		<a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">teensy++ 2.0</a> 
		development board.&nbsp; This is a better option than the USBKey because 
		it is cheaper ($24 at last check) and only has the essential chip and 
		supporting circuitry.&nbsp; Most IO pins are available (46 of them).</p>
<p>The firmware for the board is configured by uploading data to 
its EEPROM.&nbsp; The configuration data controls some hardware attributes, but 
mostly it just defines what component is connected to which I/O pin.&nbsp; The 
configuration data is made using a GUI application, which can then upload 
changes to the firmware.&nbsp; As long as the boot loader firmware remains 
intact, no programming hardware is necessary.</p>
